# Modules

This directory hosts modular components that encapsulate specific functionality and can be used across different contexts in the application. Modules are more complex than simple UI components, often comprising multiple other components and containing more complex logic. Examples include components like `YoutubeEmbed`, `CallToActions`, etc.
